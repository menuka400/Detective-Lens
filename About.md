ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project: Detective Lens and Flask! 

I built a web application that uses YOLOv8 to perform object detection. The project involves setting up a Flask backend to handle image uploads, processing them using a YOLOv8 model, and saving the results in organized directories. 

ðŸ›  Technologies Used:
- Python
- Flask
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- YOLOv8

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:
- Object detection on uploaded images.
- Automatic image and text extraction.
- Simple web interface for easy interaction.
- Outputs are saved with unique filenames to prevent overwriting.
